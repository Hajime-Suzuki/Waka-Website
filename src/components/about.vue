      p Waka is a jazz singer from the most unlikely of backgrounds. She was born in the heart of the city of Tokyo, growing up in a typical tiny city-apartment, without any music around her but the deepest silence.

      p Since her childhood, she promptly did whatever her curiosity took her; taking magic lessons, practicing Kendo, going to dancing schools. When she  turned 16 years old, she made a decision to leave Tokyo for a while and live somewhere else. She got enrolled to a local high school in the middle of cotton fields in the state of Mississippi, the U.S., where she had her destined encounters of her life, Philosophy and Jazz.
